- Deep Learning on text   

Some of my projects :   

* [NOAA Weather Ingestion] (https://github.com/ddatta-DAC/NOAA_Weather_Fetcher)

* [Deep Auto Encoder Tutorial] (https://github.com/ddatta-DAC/ConvolutionalAutoencoder)

* [Time Series Analysis] (https://github.com/ddatta-DAC/Time-Series-Analysis)
  This repository has around 8 deep learning models implemented to analyze their performance on predicting timeseries , using exogenous variables - akin to ARX (Auto regressive with exogenous).
