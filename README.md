## Biography

Debanjan obtained his PhD in Computer Science from Virginia Tech, advised by Dr.Naren Ramakrishan. His core research field was Data Mining and Machine Learning with large scale data, with research focus on Anomaly Detection in Tabular Data. His thesis work consisted of developing detection detection algorithms, explainability and algorithmic recourse for anomaly detection. He has also worked in multiple other projects involving NLP, CV, Time Series, graphs and general data mining.

He is currently Applied Scientist at Amazon Web Services, SageMaker Team working on AutoML related technologies. Prior to his ML focused work and graduate school, he worked as Software Development Engineer in Yahoo Inc. In Yahoo he worked on multiple web service related technologies, data management and automation.
